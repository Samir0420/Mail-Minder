# Mail-Minder: Automated Email Scheduler in Python

Mail-Minder is a Python project designed to simplify the process of scheduling and sending automated emails. Whether you want to send reminders, notifications, or updates, Mail-Minder has got you covered. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

## Introduction

Mail-Minder is an automated email scheduler built using Python. It empowers users to schedule emails for future delivery, eliminating the need for manual email sending.

## Usage

1. Download the Python code
2. Change the sender and receiver emails
3. Add your subject and message that will be sent in the email
4. Schedule the time you would like to send it
5. Run the Python code and the email will be sent at the scheduled time

## How to automate

There is 1 way to automate this (at the moment):
1. Use the Windows task scheduler or macOS Automator to run the Python script

If there are other ways, I will make sure to include them!


## Additional Notes:

This project was designed to send weekly reminders to students who had tutoring sessions with me. This is why I have incorporated the time and schedule modules into my code. I wanted to make my life easier and avoid making new reminder emails to my students. What better way to do it than by creating a Python script using my coding knowledge?
